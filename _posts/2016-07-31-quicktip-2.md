Hello guys,  
No introduction needed! Let's go straight for our quick tip number 2.

# Goal

Debug the view controllers hierarchy in the console as sometimes the Xcode UI Debugger can't give us what we are looking for<!--more-->

# Tip

1. Add a breakpoint where you want to debug the views and put the following code in the debugger console once you reach your breakpoint:
2. Run the command in the lldb console  

When debugging Objective-C code:

```lldb
po [UIViewController _printHierarchy]
```
and for Swift:
```lldb
expr -l objc++ -O -- [UIViewController _printHierarchy]
```

# Example

Below an output example of when using this command :

```lldb
<PieOverlayMenu.PieOverlayMenu 0x7f86854755e0>, state: appeared, view: <UIView 0x7f868548c500>
   | <Pie_for_Drivers.SplitViewController 0x7f8686877800>, state: appeared, view: <UILayoutContainerView 0x7f8684ce8410>
   |    | <UINavigationController 0x7f8688896200>, state: appeared, view: <UILayoutContainerView 0x7f8685417d10>
   |    |    | <Pie_for_Drivers.LegsListViewController 0x7f8685604f40>, state: appeared, view: <UIView 0x7f8684d51290>
   |    | <Pie_for_Drivers.MapViewController 0x7f8685416e10>, state: appeared, view: <UIView 0x7f86851dab80>
   | <PieOverlayMenu.PieOverlayMenuContentViewController 0x7f8685476080>, state: appeared, view: <UIView 0x7f86855423c0>
   |    | <Pie_for_Drivers.MenuViewController 0x7f8685474320>, state: appeared, view: <UIView 0x7f86854845b0>
```

       
# Under the hood

Apple added the [debub view hierarchy](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/debugging_with_xcode/chapters/special_debugging_workflows.html) feature in XCode 6. But to inspect the view controller hierarchy Apple only introduced this private helper : [_printHierarchy](https://github.com/nst/iOS-Runtime-Headers/blob/a8f9f7eb4882c9dfc87166d876c547b75a24c5bb/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/UIViewController.h#L365) silently in iOS 8.

Let me now explain what the expression does.  
Basically, it's just calling the private helper :P

However, the command is different for Swift and Objective-C simply because the methode `_printHierarchy` isn't available in Swift.  
So what we do here is that we tell LLDB to execute an Objective-C expression.

Let's break down the command for Swift code :

* `po` (for print object) is simply an alias to `expr -O --`  
* `-l objc++` is here to specify the language used.

<br/><br/>Voila!
