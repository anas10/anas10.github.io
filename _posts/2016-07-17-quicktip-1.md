Hello there,  
I'm so excited to start this Quicktip series today.
The goal of this serie of articles is to give you some tips in a short, precise and consise way.
So enough talk and let's get started.

# Goal

The idea is to be able to have different podfile configurations based on the current environnement.<!--more-->

# Tip

Simply check environnement variables in your podfile.  
You can access and environnement variable this way : `ENV['USER']`

# Example

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
inhibit_all_warnings!

target 'TargetName' do

    if ['anas'].include?(ENV['USER']) #1
    	# IF CURRENT USER IS ME, I use the local path
    	pod 'AABlurAlertController', :path => "#{ENV['POD_LOCAL_HOME']}/AABlurAlertController"
    	
       else
       # ELSE (CI for example) I use the github repository
       pod 'AABlurAlertController', :git => 'git@github.com:anas10/AABlurAlertController.git', :branch => 'master'
       
    end

    pod 'AASquaresLoading'
	[...]
	
    target 'TargetNameTests' do
        inherit! :search_paths
        
		 [...]
    end
end
```
The important part is `#1` where we check the environement user and then act accordingly.

Here we go with our first quick tip.  
Let me know what you think and see you soon.

**UPDATE : 04/04/17**

I did something else recently that makes more sense in many cases.  
Instead of looking for the user via an environment variable, I just look for a specific environnement variable such as `LOCALPODS`  

```ruby
if ENV['LOCALPODS']
	pod 'AABlurAlertController', :path => "#{ENV['POD_LOCAL_HOME']}/AABlurAlertController"    
else
	pod 'AABlurAlertController', :git => 'git@github.com:anas10/AABlurAlertController.git', :branch => 'master'
end
```

Ans I set this variable only when needed before a pod install like this : `LOCALPODS=true pod install`
