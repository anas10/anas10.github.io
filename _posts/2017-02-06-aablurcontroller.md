As often my work is done for companies or personal projects, I don't often end up sharing what I do. 

So from time to time, I like to take a moment to create a pod out of some code that I wrote for something else.   <!--more-->
And if people like it and use it, I am more than happy to work on it and adapt it to their needs. It's just my way to say thank you to all the people out there making amazing libraries that I use myself.
 
Anyway, I've decided to share them also on my blog now.  
And this is the first one that I would like to post here.

I'm really bad at finding a name, so I decided to call it: AABlurAlertController.  
It is a custom alert controller with a blurred background that you can use anywhere in your app.  
It is fully written in Swift (3.0 as I'm writing this).

You can find it on Github at : [AABlurAlertController](https://github.com/anas10/AABlurAlertController)

Hope you like it.
